#Improvements for next iteration

* Add edit functionality to playdates and places.
* Filter playdates on dashboard to be only future playdates
* Include playdates that pets are going to on dashboard (currently just shows playdates being hosted)
* Move all dates and times to unix format.  Currently date and time counts on user using correct format
* Form validation on client and server side

#Challenges
* I spent a fair amount of time troubleshooting Pagoda for live deployment, and I missed some opportunities to work more or laravel code rather than deployment.  For instance my forms and app are very fragile at this point - I would like to have more validation and user protection.

* Queries on many to many relationships are still a challenge.


#Outside code
